#Conversations with Tyler
[*Conversations with Tyler*](https://conversationswithtyler.com/) is a non typical interview podcast from Tyler Cowen of GMU.
What makes this podcast unique is that Tyler extensively studies the material about the subject of the interview and is able to get almost every
interviewee to break out of their normal rehearsed material and engage in a meaningful conversation. Tyler has broad interests and makes sure to 
touch on multiple topics with each guest. I am currently planning to relisten to every episode (currently 215) and will provide a review for each one.
These episodes are graded on a curve with
1 being a recommendation to skip (from memory this is rare),
2 being skippable (I will use this generously because there are 200+ episodes but many of these are quite good),
3 being solid episodes,
4 being great episodes you should seek out,
and 5 being an absolute essential for repeated relistens.
