# Stratechery
[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) is a mostly paid subscription covering 
*Stratechery* by Ben Thompson,
*Dithering* by Ben Thompson and [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/),
*Sharp Tech* with Andrew Sharp and Ben Thompson,
and several Andrew Sharp non tech podcasts (*Sharp China*, *Greatest of all talk*)

I highly recommend paying for the subscription for most people interested in Silicon Valley but because this is a paid subscription I will limit my reviews.
